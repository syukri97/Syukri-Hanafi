This is the fake news detection using machine learning.
This project is different from anywhere as we try to train the machine learning model into Malay Language dataset.
We use several Machine Learning Algorithm such as Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
The dataset used also include together to the public for further research.
Our dataset was exclusively provided by Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission
The source of our data is from Sebenarnya.my https://sebenarnya.my/ in year 2017-2020
